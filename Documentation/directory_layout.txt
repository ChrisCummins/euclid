		Euclid kernel source directory structure

This document describes the layout of the the Euclid kernel source tree; which
is essentially a clone of Linux source structure. The rationale behind this is
that it negates the need for learning a new project layout, and this reduced
size source tree can help in getting comfortable browsing the much more
intimidatingly large Linux tree.

arch/
	This directory contains subdirectories for each supported
	architecture. All architecture-sepcific code goes in the respective
	directory, e.g., arch/x86/.

arch/<arch>/boot
	This directory contains boot routines, and is the destination for the
	final compiled image.

arch/<arch>/include
	Architecture-specific kernel headers.

Documentation/
	This directory contains documentation for Euclid.

fs/
	Implementations for filesystems and the virtual filesystem (VFS).

include/
	Kernel headers.

init/
	Kernel initialisation and boot-time code.

lib/
	Euclid library sources.

kernel/
	The core kernel components live in here.

mm/
	The memory managment subsystem.

scripts/
	A collection of helper scripts for building and working with the
	sources. Contains scripts for emulating the kernel on a host system.

usr/
	The initial filesystem (initramfs) used in early boot process.

toos/
	A collection of helpful tools.
